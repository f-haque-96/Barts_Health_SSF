-- Migration 001: Initial Schema
-- Created: 2026-02-13
-- Description: Baseline schema from schema.sql v3.0
-- =============================================================================
-- This migration is the baseline. It matches the existing schema.sql exactly.
-- If the database already has these tables, this migration will be skipped
-- (the runner marks it as applied without executing).
--
-- For fresh deployments, run schema.sql directly then mark this as applied.
-- =============================================================================

-- This file intentionally left as a marker.
-- The initial schema is applied via schema.sql for new environments.
-- The migration runner will record this as the baseline.

PRINT 'Migration 001: Initial schema baseline recorded';
