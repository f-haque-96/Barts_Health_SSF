# Development Mode Guide

## Frontend only (current default)

Use this while backend infrastructure is being prepared:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Full stack (when backend setup is available)

Set backend environment values in `supplier-form-api/.env` and run backend services per deployment setup docs.
